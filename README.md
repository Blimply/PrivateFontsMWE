# PrivateFontsMWE

This is a small command line application to demonstrate a problem with Telerik 2016 Q3 Private Fonts functionality. The problem is
when a font is installed it is aligned differently than when it is used via the privateFonts configuration.

The two pdfs are example output of this tool (note the differently aligned header texts)
